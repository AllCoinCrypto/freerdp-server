```
Console access is restricted to root by default which essentially means that without making any further changes, connections by anyone else will be dropped. This is obviously not the required user experience, therefore access to the console will need to be configured for all users.

To change access from root only to all users we simply edit the file /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config

This can be done by using an editor such as nano to manually change the line allowed_users=console to allowed_users=anybody.

Alternatively, it can also be updated by running the following command to make the changes.

sudo sed -i 's/allowed_users=console/allowed_users=anybody/' /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config
```
